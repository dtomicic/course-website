## Project task
Project goal was to build a website that can communicate with the database, store and pull info from it. This project helped me get familliar with PHP and how it helps us connect to the database and get data from it. Website pulls courses info from the database and displays it on the main page and also the site features an admin login (checked against database) which allows the admin direct input of the course from the website with some minor issues. All of it was done in simple plain PHP, no protection or complex validation was done yet however it is planned in the future, also for the picture upload it requires direct upload to the database.
